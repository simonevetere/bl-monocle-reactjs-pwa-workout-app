### About

This is a workout app, has no CV aspect to it, pretty much a HUD interface

It is a sub-app for the PWA react app launcher

### App flow

### JS to micropython/monocle

I'm building on top of the bluetooth via JS capability (Chrome) provided by this [library](https://github.com/siliconwitchery/web-bluetooth-repl).
